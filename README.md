# Konfidio-challenge
Hi! 
Thank you for reviewing my code challenge. 
I'm sorry but i could not find the time to pass it through a linter, still the style should be decent.
I left you a suite of tests so just run 'npm run test' to make sure everything is running as intended..
Also left a dump with the Postman collection i used while developing. I'm sure you'll be able to import it and start making requests right away.
Start by creating new Accounts for the existing users(1 to 6) and remember to save the AccountId's as you'll need them for the other requests.
By each route you'll find a simple example.

ps: in my postman collection, the new account request might apear as POST.. it was a last minute change, PUT is the correct verb for this request
